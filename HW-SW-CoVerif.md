# Bridging the Gap: Integrating PSS with Hardware-Software Co-Verification

In today's fast changing technological landscape, the line between hardware and software gets increasingly blurred. Today's systems, including smartphones, self-driving cars, Internet of Things devices, and industrial automation, rely largely on software-hardware interactions. Co-verification has become an integral component of the design process as hardware and software become more interdependent. Co-verification ensures that every part of a product functions properly in the real world by combining testing features from both hardware and software.

Hardware and software are traditionally verified on separate tracks, with their own methodologies based around discrete tools. Unfortunately, this method proves insufficient when the systems become too complicated and as a result do not identify some subtle - yet very important bugs based on interactions between hardware and software. Some of these bugs may cause system crashes, security holes or other unwanted effects. Hence, it is clear that a more Unified Verification Strategy was needed.

The Portable Stimulus Standard (PSS) is useful in this situation. The PSS standard, developed by Accellera, is a potent tool that may be used to create automated, reusable, and portable test scenarios for both software and hardware, thereby addressing the issues associated with contemporary verification. Verification engineers may ensure that all interactions are adequately tested and confirmed by bridging the gap between hardware and software with PSS.

In this blog, we will take a look at how PSS may be effectively integrated into hardware-software co-verification. We will explore PSS's role in software-driven verification, discuss practical examples of PSS-powered hardware-software co-verification, and talk about the difficulties and solutions that arise in mixed hardware-software environments.


## I. Understanding the Need for Hardware-Software Co-Verification

Modern electronic systems have now become much more complex, embedding high-performance hardware capabilities with sophisticated software. Unlike the older, simpler devices, today's systems integrate many hardware components, including processors, memory units, and peripherals, with complex software layers comprising operating systems, drivers, and applications. This level of integration requires seamless interaction between hardware and software for the system to operate correctly and meet design specifications.

### A. Critical Applications That Need Precise Hardware-Software Synchronisation Include the Following:

- **Automotive systems**: Automotive Systems can be considered classic examples of embedded systems, starting with engine control units and advanced driver assistance in modern cars. These involve precise interaction among hardware components including sensors and actuators with software algorithms for real-time braking, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance, among others. Any mismatch in hardware-software pairing can trigger a flaw in either safety or system malfunction.

- **Aerospace Systems**: Any aerospace application, such as aircraft avionics systems, needs both high reliability and accuracy. Software has been entrusted to take over critical hardware operations like navigation, communication, and flight control systems. Ensuring the correct interaction of software with hardware in all possible operation scenarios is crucial for guaranteeing safety and performance of the aircraft.

- **Medical Devices:** Medical devices involve everything from very simple pacemakers to highly sophisticated diagnostic imaging systems; hardware, including stimulators and sensors, and software, including signal processing and diagnostics. Poor synchronisation in this interaction can result in hazardous medical consequences and failures in diagnosis.

- **Industrial Automation**: Synchronous use of hardware components like motors, sensors, along with control software, by industrial control systems and robots for activities such as manufacturing, quality control, and material handling. Only through effective integration between the hardware and software can good efficiency and error-free functioning result.

### B. Traditional Verification Approaches
In the past, various methods relevant to each area have been used to verify hardware and software:

- **Hardware Verification**: Emulation, simulation, and formal verification are examples of traditional techniques for hardware verification. These methods evaluate the performance and functionality of hardware components either individually or in controlled environments.
  
- **Software Verification**: Software verification typically involves techniques such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. These techniques, which typically make use of virtual environments or mock hardware, evaluate the correctness and functionality of software components.

Even while these conventional methods work well in the domains they cover, they are unable to handle problems that result from the interaction of hardware and software. For instance, testing hardware alone might not reveal software bugs related to timing or synchronization, and software testing without considering hardware contexts might miss critical integration problems.

### C. Limitations of Traditional Methods

- **Insufficient Integration Testing:** Most traditional testing methods focus on separate, individual testing of hardware and software. This may allow for the missing of big issues based on how these elements actually work with each other in real situations-a reason for incomplete test coverage.

- **Manage Complexity**: With systems getting increasingly complex, it is difficult to keep supporting various verification methodologies for software and hardware. The complexity of systems today demands a unified approach for assurance that verification is thorough and effective.

- **Late Issue Detection**: Issues related to the interaction of hardware and software can be detected much later, depending on the stage of the development cycle. Fixes due to such delayed discovery are costly and time-consuming, impinging on the budgets and schedules of projects.

- **Difficulty in Simulating Real-World conditions:** This is because conventional methods can hardly model the wide variation in changing circumstances occurring during real-world operation. Limitation in the simulation makes it difficult to find problems which show up under particular real-world conditions.

Understanding such limitations underlines the importance of co-verification between hardware and software. The inclusion of PSS in verification provides a complete bridge between hardware and software interaction, thus ensuring all interactions are properly tested and validated to achieve more reliable and robust system design.

## II. PSS Integration with Software-Driven Verification

Software-driven verification is a test methodology that tries to validate how the software interacts with the real hardware. Other traditional verification methodologies will validate the hardware and software components individually, whereas software-driven verification tries to integrate both and perform a test together. This approach makes sure that the software really controls, commands, and talks to the hardware components, which are vital in today's complex systems.

### A. Importance of Software-Driven Verification in Validating Software-Hardware Interactions

In most embedded systems, software controls critical hardware components. In automotive systems, for example, software operates sensors, actuators, and other ECUs to safely handle the vehicle. Such interactions are very important to validate because any discrepancy between the software request and the hardware response always results in system failures, safety issues, or bad performance. Software-driven verification emphasizes such vulnerabilities under realistic operational scenarios where software-to-hardware interaction plays an important role.

### B. Utilizing PSS for Software-Driven Test Scenarios

The Portable Stimulus Standard PSS describes and automates complex test scenarios involved in both hardware and software. PSS enables the test engineers to create abstract models of the test scenarios that are aware of both hardware and software. This further can be automatically transformed into an executable set of test cases controlling both the software and hardware under test.

- **Definition of Scenarios**: PSS allows the engineer to define test scenarios at a high level, focusing on what of test instead of how to execute. A scenario in this regard may include initializing hardware components, loading drivers, and running specified software commands in order to test the system's response.
- **Scenario Execution**: Once the PSS model has been specified, tools generate executable tests that can be run either on real hardware or in simulation environments. In fact, this kind of automatic execution will guarantee that the defined scenarios are thoroughly checked with no human intervention

#### 1. A Practical Example

**Scenario**: Verifying the Boot Sequence of an Embedded System

Let's now look at a practical use of PSS applied successfully in software-driven verification. As an example, it could be used to check the boot sequence of an embedded system. The boot sequence is a necessary step in the operating process of the system, which then loads all the required drivers, initializes hardware, and gets the operating system ready to start. As such, this would need to be pretty well tested in order to catch any unexpected behavior or failures to initialize as early as possible.

##### a. Step 1: Define the PSS Model
To kick-start the work in PSS, a model needs to be defined that can really embody the fundamental elements of the boot process. Based upon this PSS model, for this example,

Hardware components include the following: 
- Processor (CPU): the primary processing unit that starts the boot process.
- Memory: Random Access Memory (RAM) and other initialized memory components.
- Peripherals: Hardware components that are required by the system to detect and configure during its boot-up, such as network interfaces, sensors, or display units.
- Storage: The operating system and bootloader are kept in non-volatile storage.

Software constitute the following:
- Bootloader: This is the software part responsible for loading the operating system and configuring the needed hardware to kick-start the boot cycle.
- Operating system (OS): The primary software that runs on the hardware and serves as an application platform.

Test Scenarios include the following:
- Normal Boot Sequence: This is the process by which the system turns on, initializes the hardware, loads the bootloader, and then gives the operating system control.
- Power Failure Scenario: This refers to a situation in which the system loses power while booting up. This scenario evaluates the system's ability to recover from an unexpected power outage.
- Peripheral Initialization Failure: A peripheral device that fails to initialize is referred to as a peripheral initialization failure. This scenario tests the system's resilience to hardware malfunctions and allows it to boot with reduced functionality.

##### b. Step 2: Creating Test Scenarios Using PSS
We can create several test scenarios using the PSS model to confirm various elements of the boot stage. Here are a few sample scenarios:

###### i. Normal Boot Sequence
- Description: This scenario assesses the system's capacity to carry out a successful boot sequence in its entirety under normal circumstances.
- Steps: 
  -  Turn on the system.
  -  Bootloader loaded from non-volatile storage and CPU initialized.
  -  The bootloader loads the operating system, sets up peripherals, and initializes memory.
  -  The operating system assumes command, finishes startup, and launches application services.
-  Anticipated Result: The system boots up successfully, with accurate initialization of all hardware and software components.
  
###### ii. Power Failure Scenario
- Description: This scenario evaluates how resilient the system is to an unexpected power outage during the boot process.
- Steps:
  - Turn on the system and start the boot process.
  - During initialization, simulate a random power outage (e.g., while loading the bootloader).
  - Turn the power back on and watch how the system starts up again.
- Anticipated Result: Upon power restoration, the system ought to identify the power outage, respond appropriately, and carry out the boot sequence successfully once again.

###### iii. Peripheral Initialization Failure
- Description: This scenario examines how the system responds to peripheral initialization errors that occur during boot.
- Steps:
  - Turn on the system and initiate the boot process.
  - Create the illusion of a peripheral (such a network interface card) not being initialized.
  - Verify whether the machine logs the problem, keeps booting, and functions with reduced functionality (like no network connection).
- Anticipated Result: The peripheral initialization failure should be recorded by the system, informing the user (if relevant) and allowing the boot process to continue without the malfunctioning device.

##### c. Step 3: Executing the PSS Scenarios
The next stage is to put the scenarios into action after they have been defined using PSS. This includes:

- Automatic Test Case Generation: The model and the derived scenarios will be guiding the creation of test cases by PSS tools automatically. Such generation ensures uniformity and reduces the need to create test scripts manually.
- Testing Real Hardware and Simulation Environments: It is possible to run the test cases generated on real hardware and also on simulation environments. Testing on real hardware helps ensure that all real-world conditions come into consideration, whereas running on simulators enables the detection of problems early in the design cycle.
- Log and Monitor: The action that the system takes is tracked and recorded while the system operates. Anything out of the expected sequence of events is flagged to take an in-depth look at it, hence making identification of just the exact action easier

##### d. Step 4: Analyzing Results and Iterating
The execution results of the scenarios are analyzed by the engineers:

- Pass/Fail Analysis: Identify whether the boot sequence succeeded or if there was an error and identify the causes of failure and conditions when failures happened. 
- Bug Identification and Reporting: Since testing based on PSS is automated, these abnormalities are reported as bugs with comprehensive logs and steps to reproduce them.
- Improvement of the Model: Adding new scenarios or refactoring existing ones to the PSS model, in an iterative cycle, reaches completeness and enriches the test strategy at each cycle.

## III. Problems and Solutions in Mixed Hardware-Software Environments

### A. Problem 1: Hardware-Software Synchronization
The most common problem that occurs in any type of mixed hardware-software environment is the synchronization issue that occurs between continuous operations of hardware and segmented software. Different parts of hardware work on different clock cycles and, hence, possess different timing constraints than those of software processes. The presence of this difference becomes highly critical if the application comes under the domain of real time because any delay or loss of synchronization will result in performance problems or complete system crashes.

#### Solutions:

PSS for the Definition of Synchronization Points and Timing Constraints: PSS basically enables a designer to specify synchronization points that provide real-time assurance related to hardware-software co-operability. A designer can thus come up with timing constraints and place synchronization markers within PSS models to subsequently simulate and check whether the interactions happen at the right time and within the pre-specified timing constraints at both the hardware and software levels.

### B. Problem 2: Scalability and Complexity Management
Verification management becomes challenging and cumbersome as the systems grow larger and complex. The interaction between various hardware and software components can multiply, which again leads to scalability and complexity challenges. Thus, comprehensive test scenarios that cover every interaction are sometimes difficult to create.

#### Solutions:

**Modular PSS Design**: A modular approach will help decompose such complex systems into smaller, manageable modules that can be independently verified and integrated with the rest of the system. This modularity in the design of PSS eases complexity, thereby making scaling in verification easier.

**Abstraction of Scenarios and Reusability of Models**: PSS enables abstractions; thus, designers can create high-level scenarios that can be shared across tests. Reusing models and scenarios saves time and redundancy, and consistency during verification.

### C. Problem 3: Debugging Co-Verification Scenarios
Most of the debugging issues are especially complex in mixed hardware-software interaction. If there is a problem, one has to trace through both hardware and software layers for the root cause. The interaction is so much intertwined that one cannot say if the problem emanates from hardware, software, or the interface of hardware and software.

#### Solutions:

**Advanced debugging tools supporting the PSS model**: Advanced debugging tools that can be supported by PSS can detect the bugs in a more precise manner. These trace the operation flows and show runtime status of hardware and software components. It is quite easy for engineers to locate the problems using such type of tool and analyze them, thus simplifying debugging in complicated scenarios.

Specific integration with existing debugging frameworks takes advantage of the strengths of available debugging frameworks and augments them with functionality specific to the PSS domain. That way, engineers can remain in their familiar tool environments while benefiting from the strength of PSS models in inspecting the hardware-software interactions.

### Problem 4: Integration with Existing Verification Environments
PSS adoption in existing verification environments, especially legacy ones, faces integration challenges. Sometimes interoperability conflicts with the integration of PSS into the existing workflow and toolchains.

#### Solutions include the following:

**PSS Adapters and Wrappers**: Writing adapters and wrappers that bridge the gap between PSS and existing verification environments will facilitate integration. These adapters translate the PSS models to formats that are compatible with legacy tools, thus allowing seamless interaction.

**Ensuring Backward Compatibility**: To make migration to PSS smooth, backward compatibility with the existing methodologies for verification should be maintained. Thus, it would be easy to integrate PSS with the flow at various teams without disrupting verification processes that are already in progress and provide a frictionless on-ramp to its adoption.

By resolving these challenges with concrete solutions, engineers can successfully leverage PSS in mixed hardware-software environments, leading to better quality verification and enabling robust, reliable system design.


## IV. Best Practices of Integrating PSS in Hardware-Software Co-Verification

### A. Start Small:

This is really important to keep models simple in PSS integration into hardware-software co-verification. Take the very simple scenarios which model the basic interactions between hardware and software components; this provides that simplicity necessary for the teams to get acquainted with the PSS concepts and process without major complexity. Starting small allows early wins, showing how PSS caught issues that could have easily been missed using traditional verification methods.

### B. Incremental Development:

One of the important practices to handle such a complex model is incremental building and testing of PSS scenarios. The decomposition of the system into smaller, tractable parts takes place instead of trying to develop comprehensive models in one go. First, the development of PSS scenarios for individual components or subsystems takes place, which is then gradually integrated to provide more complex interactions. This kind of step-by-step approach helps in isolating problems and ensures that each component is thoroughly verified before going for more complex integrations.

### C. Collaboration between Teams:

PSS integration can only be effective through collaboration between hardware and software teams. Both bring very valuable insights into the verification process. Hardware engineers can comment on the capabilities and inefficiencies of the hardware, while software engineers are in a place to provide much-needed insight into what behavior and requirements the software has. If both teams work together and define comprehensive PSS scenarios, then hardware/ software interaction can be modeled and tested accurately. Regular communication and joint review sessions will help both teams be on the same page.

### D. Continuous Testing and Refinement:

Emphasize on continuous verification approach based on PSS through the development life cycle. Update continuously and refine PSS models as updated representative model of the system at each new addition or modification of features. This enables one to catch issues early, reducing the possibility of finding critical problems late in the development cycle. With continuous testing, teams can also make sure that the system retains integrity and reliability through its change and evolution process. That means that all hardware-software interactions keep up with each other, working correctly.

Considering these practices, PSS can be effectively integrated into the processes of hardware-software co-verification. Therefore, verification coverage will go up, collaboration over groups improves, and so forth, leading to robust and reliable system designs.


## V. Future of Hardware-Software Co-Verification with PSS

#### **Emerging Trends in Verification:**

Technology, as it improves, does the modes and tools. Emerging trends like AI-driven verification and machine learning will go a long way in boosting the capabilities of PSS. The AI algorithms can analyze enormous data for verification data and pick up the patterns and consider predicting possible failure points. These predictions can form part of PSS scenarios. Machine learning will play a significant role in optimizing test coverage through automatic scenario generation, targeting the most critical parts of the interaction between hardware and software. These technologies can be employed to prioritize test cases, predict issues that may arise, and adapt to new use cases with much speed and comprehensiveness.

#### **PSS Evolution:**

Portable Stimulus Standard will have to evolve to handle this increasing system complexity. With growing system complexity, the PSSs should be able to provide support for more detailed and sophisticated modeling. Examples of such evolutions are complex modeling of timing requirements, more heterogeneous hardware architecture support, and integrating real-time constraints. Improvements in the PSS may also be related to heterogeneous systems support, where a variety of processors and components interact. Its further evolution in the future will be geared toward making PSS more usable, scalable, and integrated with other verification tools to reach a bigger circle of engineers and projects.

#### **Industry Adoption:**

Adoption of PSS in the industry will play an important role for shaping the future of hardware-software co-verification. With more companies realizing the value of a single verification strategy spanning hardware and software, the PSS adoption is bound to grow. Industry standards will further evolve; the tendency could be that PSS might become essential in the verification process. In addition, higher complexities of products in segments such as automotive, aerospace, and IoT are likely to drive demand for more robust verification methodologies. With the PSS gaining acceptance in the industry, we can indeed look forward to institutionalization of best practices, further integration of the PSS with the existing verification frameworks, and community involvement in its continuous improvement.

A bright future lies ahead for hardware-software co-verification with PSS. Emerging technologies such as AI and machine learning, coupled with continuous evolution in the capabilities of PSS and greater industry-wide adoption, will be the great facilitators toward a comprehensive and efficient verification strategy that will ensure such complex systems run reliably and safely to meet modern technology's exploding demands.
